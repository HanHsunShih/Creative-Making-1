# Creative-Making-Final-Project
## Week 5 Project Proposal
### Concept
I owned a cat back in Taiwan but couldn’t bring him here, whenever I feel lonely I would think about him. I think it’s better for me to have a pet here to keep my company but sometimes I travel around so I couldn’t take care of it all the time. It’s better to create a mechanical pet rather than owning a real one.<br>
